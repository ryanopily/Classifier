# Classifier Web Scraper
### Purpose
To scrape data from University at Buffalo's online [class schedule](https://www.buffalo.edu/class-schedule?semester=fall) and compile it into a MySQL database. This way, it can be used in software applications.

### Setup
You will need a local MySQL server running on your computer.
The project is already set up to work with [this one](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/), although you can modify the project to work with whatever you'd like.

Then update the url, username, and password variables in **ml.zer0dasho.classifier.Main** to reflect those of your database.

Then you can run the program in your favorite IDE or through the command line.
